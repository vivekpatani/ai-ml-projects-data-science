% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
\usepackage{blindtext, graphicx}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Let\'s understand what does a Memory Based Learner mean? To simply put it in words, we can classify them as tools to find similarity between earlier and newer experiences. They can be divided into 2 functional components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Learning Component} - This is the memory based part where in you \textit{learn} the existing data and form a base case.
\item \textbf{Performance Content} - This is the similarity based part where in you introduce a similarity measure and check how similar two data points are from the learning component.
\end{itemize}

\section{Memory Based Learning}
Before we delve into the anyltical comparison, we should just get a brief overview of the various similarity/dissimilarity measures along with the different algorithms provided TiMBL.

\subsection{Distance Measures/Metrics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Overlap Metric} -- Simple sum of difference between two features. There are two variants in which it can be implemented, \textbf{Levenshtein} and \textbf{Dice} Coefficients. They have minor difference in implementation details.
\item \textbf{Information Gain \& Gain Ratio Feature Weighing} -- Infromation Gain reveals the isolated entropy of a feature between the two experiences. However, IG (Information Gain) fails to generalise and hence \textbf{Gain Ratio} is used, which normalise the IG by a factor of Split Info value.
\item \textbf{Chi Squared \& Shared Variance Feature Weighing} -- To overcome the drawbacks of Gain Ratio, where in feature selection is carried out based on statistical degrees of freedom. Shared Variance helps Chi Squared value to be more accurate.
\item \textbf{Modified Value Diff \& Jeffrey Diversion Metrics} -- Interestingly enough this is different from the all the methods mentioned above. MVDM (Modified Value Difference Metrics) is a method which calculates the co-occurence of features comparing it to the target class. Jeffrey Metrics is a measure of dissimilarity as compared to other metrics that we've seen.
\item \textbf{Dot - Products \& Cosine Metrics} -- When you have numeric or binary features, you can use a simple dot product. A Cosine Metric is once again a variant of the dot product.
\item \textbf{Distance Weighted Class Voting and Other Methods} -- This is used as a base method for K Nearest Neighbours (Max Vote Method). Other methods consist of Tie - Breaking and Exemplar Weighting.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithms/Indexing Strategies}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{IB1} -- As the size of the dataset increases, the access times can become more taxing and hence an Tree Based Indexing is used. IB1 is implemented using this idea.
\item \textbf{IGTree} -- Based on the Information Gain, this is a different implementation where in the same tree from IB1 is in a compressed manner. IG is used as a parameter for the arc selection.
\item \textbf{TRIBL \& TRIBL2} -- To cover drawbacks from the IGTree and IB1 (or IB1-G), TRIBL \& TRIBL2 came into existence. The simple difference between the two is that TRIBL fixes the point in feature ordering and TRIBL2 automatically selects that each classification.
\item \textbf{IB2 \& Others} -- This is a good strategy since each misclassification of kNN is recorded and kept in memory. The storage is much optimised, but fails at being disinterested while judging.  It is fairly sensitive to noise.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\caption{Simulation results}

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline

%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



\section{Comparative Anaylsis}

\subsection{Statistical Insights}
The above mentioned information will now guide us to analysing the data mentioned for Word Sense Disambiguation.\\
Our first most or basic most observation is that while training, \textbf{Optimised training is always better} than the default set of training parameters. One more interesting pattern here is that while evaluating when you fine tune it, the accuracy almost always drops or remains equal but never better than as compared to the coarse tuning. Basic intuition would also indicate the same thing. If you observe carefully, you observe a large (or maximum pertaining to the table) difference between your training default setting and optimised setting for the words:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{consume} -- 25.9
\item \textbf{bet as v} -- 24.3
\item \textbf{float as n} -- 19.4
\end{itemize}
but while evaluation you see that there isn't as significant a difference between coarse and fine tuning compared to the training settings. However there is a significant peculiarity for the difference in accuracies of fine tuning and coarse tuning because all the words that appeared do not neccesarily repeat here (which means training data is not exactly telling you the accuracy measure):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{giant as n} -- 18.7
\item \textbf{scrap as n} -- 17.9
\item \textbf{promise as n} -- 14.2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peculiarities}
\par For any algorithm we know how important \textbf{robustness}[1] is. Robustness can be defined in \textit{n} number of ways. In this case I would like to define it as the least amount of variance between the baseline and optimised parameters while training. The \textbf{k} that would be ideally used is 5 with \textbf{MVDM - IG}. The decision is based on the least amount of variance. Variance is simply calculated by subtracting average out of each of the differences (between baseline and optimal setting scores) and summing up all of the square of differences (or just add the differences). The results which turns out to be the lowest is the most robust since it will not be attenuated easily. The variance for MVDM IG is about 772 (0 if you simply sum). The next closest was MVDM IG with k as 1, with a variance of about 1000 (-0.2 if you simply sum).

\par If you observe, all the values of k are odd in nature (1,3,5,7,etc.). This is for a reason and not coincidence. It is recommended to keep k odd because each neighbour should have a majority and keeping it even may result in a tie and a majority would not come out. Hence, odd it is.

\par In general we know monosemous words are easy to disambiguate as compared to polysemous words. Words like \textbf{Giant} (as Adjective) have only one meaning (from its other form such as Noun), even the table depicts the same result. The word has a high baseline in itself and even the training \& evaluation depict the very same. Now, a word like float (the Verb form) can be quite tricky to disambiguate. You can float on water and across air. Sentences in the dataset seem to be really close to each meaning and the table shows that the baseline is low and so is the overall accuracy. Just as a fact, words like \textit{run} \& \textit{take} have over 100 meanings and can be utterly difficult to disambiguate since you need to test a lot of meanings before you drive yourself to a conclusion.

\par Looking at individual features maybe interesting but looking at the bigger picture gives you a few insights too. A 10 fold cross validation is carried out to avoid having a biased classifier and hence a biased output. I feel that Cross Validation neutralises the idea of difficulty that may occur during training or testing but nonetheless, we see as given in the table that training the dataset is difficult as compared to the easy evaluation set. The efforts required in improving baseline accuracy to training accuracy followed by optimisations is far more as compared to testing with the help of already given training set since tuning does not drastically improve the accuracy comparatively.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{picture}}]{John Doe}
\blindtext

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
