A device driver is a program that controls a particular type of device that is attached to your computer. There are device drivers for printers, displays, CD-ROM readers, diskette drives, and so on. A driver acts like a translator between the device and programs that use the device. Each device has its own set of specialized commands that only its driver knows. In contrast, most programs accessdevices by using generic commands. The driver, therefore, accepts generic commands from a program and then translates them into specialized commands for the device.
