Can someone knowledgeable in this please provide a step-by-step process and mention the programs used?
Whenver I go to install new video drivers, I uninstall the old one through device manager and reboot. But when the machine reboots, Windows XP detects the new hardware and wants to start installing some drivers, so I keep telling it to cancel but it keeps fighting back and wanting to install another driver. Finally, I get it to stop but I'm not sure how far into the install XP got before I was able to stop this. Then I install the new driver, but I'm never confident it was a clean install, though I've never had any driver issues I'm aware of.
There's got to be a better process. I know a few people who just install the new driver on top of the old driver, but I know that's not recommended.
You un-installed but did you clean out everything before you install the new one? If you do than it should be fine and always verify it after you install. Most driver version whether it's ATI or Nvidia usually provide it with a "Uninstall Utility" to clean out any previous driver(s) before you install any new one. But sometime they don't always work, so most of the time you have to manually remove it. Here's what you need to do:
After you uninstall from the "Device Manager", sometime it will ask for you to reboot in order to complete the un-installation. Whether it prompted or not "DO NOT REBOOT" instead just cancel it.
Go into your GPU driver folder (Usually by default at C:\Program files\ATI or Nvidia) and delete the folder. Now reboot, and when window loads up and a new "Hardware Found" just cancel it.
Now, install the new drivers and follow the on-screen and than reboot when finish. When window loads up it should automatic load the new driver. But if not than you have to manually point it to the new GPU driver folder and it should load from there.
