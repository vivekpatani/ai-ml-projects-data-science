Device driver live inside the operating system which are not indepedent programs and do not run all the time. Device Drivers are instead just a set of functions that are part of a larger program, and when that larger program needs them, they are called. If the functions crash, the whole program crashes. If the functions loop forever, the OS locks up.  Sometimes it just locks the device, other times it locks the whole OS. There are two ways. Device Drivers can either be compiled into the OS, which means they are already available, or they can be loaded as modules, which means they only use RAM when needed. If drivers are modules, there is a small bit of extra code needed.
